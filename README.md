# Longest-Chain-Problem
The idea to find the longest chain of words, where each word is a one letter extension of the previous word. The words are read from a text file and compared with each other using an algorithm. The program takes a while to run but the same can be done using graph theory very quick. I did this one to assist a friend of mine in a class project.
